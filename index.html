		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/sean.JPG">
		<p>I graduated from Towson University with a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Media and Film. From there, I moved to Florida, where I became a teacher. In addition to teaching Language Arts, intensive reading, and creative writing, I also managed the school's morning news program. I then earned my Master's in Educational Leadership from the Univeristy of Central Florida.</p>
		<p>I transitioned to a role outside of the classroom, called an Educational Technology Facilitator. My duties include resolving technical issues on campus, maintaining computer labs for student testing, and teaching coding and robotics.<p>
		<p>While I have played a strong role in education for over ten years, I feel I am ready to take that next step and challenge myself by becoming a full stack web developer. This page highlights my work.</p>
