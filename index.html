	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<img src="assets/images/sean.jpg" alt="Sean Capelle" style="width:100px;height:133px;">
	<p>I graduated from Towson University with a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Media and Film. From there, I moved to Florida, where I became a teacher. In addition to teaching Language Arts, intensive reading, and creative writing, I also managed the school's morning news program. I then earned my Master's in Educational Leadership from the Univeristy of Central Florida. I transitioned to a role outside of the classroom, called an Educational Technology Facilitator. My duties include resolving technical issues on campus, maintaining computer labs for student testing, and teaching coding and robotics.</p>
	<p>While I have played a strong role in education for over ten years, I feel I am ready to take that next step and challenge myself by becoming a full stack web developer. This page highlights my work.</p>
